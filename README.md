I am a Game designer and developer trained in the languages of C++, C# , Java and Lua(for now!). I have a moderate knowledge in pixel art, 3d modeling and programs such as Unity(3d and 2d), Roblox studio and Blender
I have a passion for learning, knowing more about a subject or seeking something new, it is always thrilling to get better at something or develop skills i never thought i would achieve. My favorite areas i have learned to this day are programming and Drawing
