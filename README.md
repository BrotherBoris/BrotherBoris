### Hi there my name is Antonio(i go by Boris as well)👋

I am a Game designer and developer trained in the languages of C#, Java, Python, Javascrip/Typescript, Dart and Swift, with a little bit of GDscript on my own.
## 🔥About Game Design and Whatnot🔥
I have a moderate knowledge in 3d modeling, drawing, texturing and programs such as Unity(3d and 2d), Godot and Blender. I am very amateur with digital drawings in Krita or Photoshop(but that don't stop me from trying) as well with some abhorrent pixel arts of mine 🤢
## ✍️ General Programming ✍️
I do the programming and software engineering, i don`t really care if back-end or front-end, we get it done!👊
My expirience is mostly on game dev and web design, doing java on JSF, Quarkus and Android Studio, C# on .Net, Unity and Godot, Python on some random desktop utility programs, Pygame, kivy, Flask and Data Mining studies on Jupyter, Swift on SwiftUI for Iphone, Typescript on Angular, last, but not least! Dart on Flutter.
## 👺Myself👺
I have a passion for learning, knowing more about a subject or seeking something new, it is always thrilling to get better at something or develop skills i never thought i would achieve. My favorite areas i have learned to this day are programming and Drawing.
I Speak fluent Portuguese and English🗣️🗣️🗣️


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Game Project(That will probably go somewhere)
